# Password_Manager
This is my Day 19 Project for 100 Days of Code Bootcamp in Python. A Password Generator GUI Application.

It has all all functionality including generating random passwords, copying them automatically to a clipboard for use to insert into a website.
It allows you to save these all to a .txt document where you can safely store all of your usernames and passwords. 
The email address is set to already be pre-populated with whatever username/email address you use most often. Just change the test@email.com to your email and it will set it.
Feel free to play around with it as you like. Mention any improvements you might see.
This is my work so please do not copy directly, but use for reference.
